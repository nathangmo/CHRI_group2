# Practicum 3


## Research Question:
To what extent does a smart controller help with high load & high precision peg in a hole in high voltage applications?

## Hypothesis:
Task completion and time with dynamic force assist is better than with constant force assist.

## Scoring metrics:
- completion time
- peg in a hole accuracy
- 

## review data:
- PA2 plots
- electric shock
- subject started with controller a / b / c


## Planning
Before March 26 Code completion
