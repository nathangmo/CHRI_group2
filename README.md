# Practicum 3


## Research Question:
To what extent does a smart controller help with high load & high precision peg in a hole in high voltage applications?

## Hypothesis:
Task completion and time with dynamic force assist is better than with constant force assist.

## Measurement metrics:
- completion time
- peg in a hole accuracy
- 

## Scoring:
safety broken: always 0 points

## Ideas
weather conditions
include lagg in the teleoperation
